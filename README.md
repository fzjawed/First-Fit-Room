This question was a bit too easy. But these questions always make you feel good because it takes < 5 mins to solve.

***You are given a list of integers rooms and an integer target. Return the first integer in rooms that's target or larger. If there is no solution, return -1.***

I just iterate over the list and find if there's any value that's the same or greater than the target value. As soon as I find the greater value I break out of the for loop.
And voila! All done.
